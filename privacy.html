                    However, in order to bridge the language gap and for the benefit of the users, we at
                    Incolearn make constant efforts to provide ad hoc support in Indian regional languages,
                    which is largely dependent on the availability of the support person (technical support,
                    TSEs, and career support). However, Incolearn does not guarantee or promise to provide the
                    course content in any of the Indian regional languages other than English.
